## (Deprecated) Looking for `Vutron` with Webpack 5 compiler?

By using the Vite compiler, we achieved our goals of reducing project and bundle size, and improving development environment and build speed.

The old **Vutron** using the Webpack 5 compiler has been split into the repositories below and will end support soon.
